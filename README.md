It uses the following pins as output in this order:

Channel_1 = PB1   Pin - 19

Channel_2 = PB0   Pin - 18

Channel_3 = PA7   Pin - 17

Channel_4 = PA6   Pin - 16

Channel_5 = PA3   Pin - 13

Channel_6 = PA2   Pin - 12

Channel_7 = PA1   Pin - 11

Channel_8 = PA0   Pin - 10

Serial Channel 2 is the input. Pin 22 at 100000 BAUD
